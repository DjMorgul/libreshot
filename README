#################
  INSTRUCTIONS
#################

LibreShot Video Editor is programmed in Python, and thus does not need
to be compiled to run.  However, be sure you have the following 
dependencies in order to run OpenShot successfully: 

1) Python 2.5+ (http://www.python.org)
2) GTK & pyGTK (http://www.pygtk.org)
3) GooCanvas & Python bindings (http://live.gnome.org/GooCanvas)
4) MLT Framework (http://www.mltframework.org)
5) Sox audio library
6) Frei0r video effect library
7) FFmpeg
8) python-pygoocanvas

To run LibreShot from the command line, use the following syntax:
(be sure to change the path to match the install location of LibreShot)

$ cd /home/USER/libreshot/bin
$ ./libreshot


#################
  HOW TO INSTALL
#################

If you would like to install LibreShot, use this command:

$ sudo python setup.py install

Installing LibreShot using this command does a few extra things that
the build wizard doesn't do.  It adds MIME Types, adds an icon to your
Application menu, registers icons, adds a /usr/bin/libreshot command, and
copies all the code files to the /site-packages/ folder.

    TUTORIAL
#################

Here is a tutorial of the current development features:

	DO YOU HAVE A HELP MANUAL?
		1) Yes, go to http://www.openshotusers.com/help/en/

	HOW DO I ADD MEDIA TO MY VIDEO PROJECT?
		1) Drag and drop videos or music files from gnome into the "Project Files" tree.
		2) Click the File / Import Files... menu
		3) Click the "Import Files" icon on the toolbar (at the top of the screen)
		
	HOW DO I ADD MEDIA TO MY TIMELINE
		1) Click on any file in your "Project Files" tree, and drag it onto the timeline (at the bottom of the screen)
		
	HOW DO I POSITION CLIPS ON THE TIMELINE
		1) Simply click on any clips already on the timeline, and drag them to their new location
		2) Use the magnet icon to have your clips magically stick to their closest neighbor clips.
		
	HOW DO I TRIM / UN-TRIM CLIPS
		1) Use the toolbar above the timeline (i.e. in the middle of the screen) and select the TRIM button
		2) Then, move your mouse over the edges of any clips.  Click and drag the edge of the clip to it's new location.

	THE AUDIO / VIDEO IS OUT OF SYNC.  WHAT CAN I DO?
		1) This is usually related to a bug in MLT or FFmpeg.  To resolve this, re-encode the video using the 
		   ffmpeg command line tool.
		   
		2) Here is an example command to convert a folder full of Canon MTS files to MP4:
		   $ find '/home/jonathan/Desktop/Caveman Movie/Videos' -iname "*.MTS" -exec ffmpeg -i {} -acodec libfaac -ab 128k -ac 2 -r 60 -vcodec mpeg4 -f mp4 -y -sameq {}.mp4 \;

		3) Usually the reason the A/V are out of sync is related to the frame rate (i.e. the -r parameter on the ffmpeg command).
		   Try a variety of frame rates and OpenShot project types to find one that doesn't have A/V sync issues.
		   Some common rates are:  -r 29.97  -r 25  -r 30  -r 60
