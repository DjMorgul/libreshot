  HOW TO INSTALL LANGUAGES?
##############################

Follow these easy steps to install a new language in LibreShot Video Editor

1) Create a folder for the language, examples:
   /usr/local/share/libreshot/libreshot/language/fr_FR/
   /usr/local/share/libreshot/libreshot/language/es_ES/
   /usr/local/share/libreshot/libreshot/language/nl_NL/

2) Create a LC_MESSAGES folder inside this new folder, examples:
   /usr/local/share/libreshot/libreshot/language/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES/

3) Drop the MO file for your language into the LC_MESSAGES folder as "LibreShot.mo"
   The name is case-sensitive, so be sure to call it "LibreShot.mo"

   Where can you find an MO file for your language you ask?  You can download them here:
   https://translations.launchpad.net/openshot

4) Run LibreShot (i.e. $ libreshot) and it should now be in a new language!!!


##############################
  STILL NEED HELP?
##############################

1) You can force OpenShot to use a specific language with this syntax, example:
   $ LANG=fr_FR libreshot

2) You must have the language installed (via the Language Support option in Ubuntu)

3) If you get this error message: 
   "Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library. Using the fallback 'C' locale."

   SOLUTION:  Step 1) Modify this file and add your language: /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
              Step 2) sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
              Step 3) Be sure the correct translation file localted at /usr/local/share/libreshot/libreshot/language/

4) fr <> fr_FR. You must match the language code exactly. If it can't find the language or locale,
   you might try experimenting with different locale strings (such as fr, fr_FR, etc...)
